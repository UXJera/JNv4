		<p><span class="keyterm">Built in:</span> Adobe Illustrator<br>This is a wireframe of the Client UI landing for the League of Legends game application. The information is centralized, with the most important information being at the top and right of the screen, while other areas are for browsing.</p>

		<a class="thumbnail" href="img/v4.jpg" data-lightbox="designs" data-title="Built in Draw.io"><img src="img/v4-sm.jpg" alt="JeremiahNyman.com v4" />JeremiahNyman.com v4</a>
		<p><span class="keyterm">Built in:</span> Draw.io<br>This was a recent mock-up of how I was planned the website redesign when I wanted to switch over to the Bootstrap framework. There were useful components that I wanted to use and learn about, including the lightbox effect.</p>
		</div>		
	<div class=" col-md-4 portfolio-block">
		<a class="thumbnail" href="img/KSN4xGrid_highres.jpg" data-lightbox="designs" data-title="Built in Adobe Illustrator"><img src="img/KSN4xGrid_medium.jpg" alt="KSN.com hero layout idea" />KSN.com hero layout idea</a>
		<p><span class="keyterm">Built in:</span> Adobe Illustrator<br>This was an idea template that could be built for one of the homepage settings on KSN.com. This layout would be useful for larger, feature stories to draw attention to the left-center.<br> Also included are ad spaces for additional revenue streams.</p>

	<!--div class=" col-md-12 portfolio-block">
		<a class="thumbnail" href="#" data-lightbox="designs" data-title=""><img src="img/radon.jpg" />Radon: The invisible killer</a>
		<p>When you buy or build a new house, you expect it to be safe, but some are slowly being poisoned by a gas seeping into their homes.<br />
		Radon comes from decaying uranium in the soil and is found in all 50 states. Outside, the radioactive gas dissipates into the air and poses no health threat, but inside a home, radon is the second-leading cause of lung cancer in the United States.</p>

<h2 class="no-bg">Website Iterations</h2>
<div class="row">
	<div class=" col-md-4 portfolio-block">
		<a class="thumbnail" href="/JNV1/" target="_blank"><img src="img/jnv1.jpg" alt="Jeremiah Nyman version 1" />Jeremiah Nyman version 1</a>
		<p><span class="keyterm">Developed early 2013</span> This was the first attempt at building a website. <br>I had used previous CSS design and tailored the content to it. <br>I didn't understand how CSS worked at the time, and had no idea what responsive design was. <br>Near the end of this version of the website, I started working for a larger, more professional website and learned more of the intricacies of proper design work.</p>
	</div>
	<div class=" col-md-4 portfolio-block">
		<a class="thumbnail" href="/JNV2/" target="_blank"><img src="img/jnv2.jpg" alt="Jeremiah Nyman version 2" />Jeremiah Nyman version 2</a>
		<p><span class="keyterm">Developed July 2014</span> I had decided that I wanted to learn more about web design and take the things I've learned and create something meaningful. I had an idea of how I wanted to build the website, but still had many issues with trying to get things to work properly. I revamped the focus of the website towards a working portfolio, as opposed to what was more of a personal website that I made for myself and friends.</p>
	</div>	
	<div class=" col-md-4 portfolio-block">
		<a class="thumbnail" href="/JNV3/" target="_blank"><img src="img/jnv3.jpg" alt="Jeremiah Nyman version 3" />Jeremiah Nyman version 3</a>
		<p><span class="keyterm">Developed Nov. 2014</span> This is the previous version of the current website, hand-coded through raw HTML and Sass without any frameworks (aside from a simple grid framework). <br>I had spent most of my time debugging and altering tiny bits of code to make things more responsive, but then I decided that I wanted to create a more interactive website built with a framework.</p>
